# Crash Beacon
Have you ever crashed your drone somewhere that is difficult to locate? The
crash beacon is a simple audio beacon to help you find your crashed drone.
Crash beacon is based on the [Light Blue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean).
This was published as an article in [Servo Magazine](http://www.servomagazine.com)
and more details on the design can be found there.
